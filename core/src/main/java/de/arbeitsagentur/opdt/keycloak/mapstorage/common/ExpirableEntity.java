/**
 * This interface provides a way for marking entities that can expire. For example, user sessions

 * storage/omitted from query results.
 *
 * <p>Presence of expired entities in the storage should be transparent to layers above the physical
 * one. This can be achieved in more ways. Ideal solution is when expired entities never reach
 * Keycloak codebase, however, this may not be possible for all storage implementations, therefore,
 * we need to double-check entities validity before they reach logical layer, for example, before we
 * turn entity into model.
 *
 * <p>Implementation of actual removal of the entities from the storage is responsibility of each
 * storage individually.
